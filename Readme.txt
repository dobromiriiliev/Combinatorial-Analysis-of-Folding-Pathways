The Visualization only shows a portion of the proteins due the computational power of the compoter I am using. The data used is taken from (https://github.com/ranaabarghout/Protein_Kinetics_Data_Scrapping).
Here is a summary of the model:
Created combinatorial algorithms to analyze folding pathways in protein folding using lattice models, aiming to elucidate the complexity of folding processes and predict kinetic properties. It incorporates combinatorial algorithms to process protein sequences and predict their folding pathways using lattice models, effectively elucidating the complexity of protein folding processes. The script integrates object-oriented programming for constructing and manipulating protein models, calculating their free energy profiles based on interactions of specific residues, and modeling their kinetic behavior based on environmental conditions such as temperature and energy barriers.
