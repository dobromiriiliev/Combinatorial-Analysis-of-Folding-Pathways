# Combinatorial Analysis of Folding Protein Pathways

**Recipient of the $1,000 MSOE Scholarship for Protein Modeling**

This project presents a computational approach to modeling protein folding kinetics using combinatorial algorithms and lattice-based models. It was awarded the $1,000 scholarship by the Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE).

##  Project Overview

The model is designed to analyze protein folding pathways through a combinatorial framework, using lattice models to simulate and predict folding behavior. It aims to elucidate the inherent complexity of protein folding mechanisms and estimate kinetic properties such as energy barriers and folding rates.

Key features include:

- **Combinatorial Algorithms**: Efficiently generate and analyze possible folding pathways of protein sequences.
- **Lattice-Based Modeling**: Abstract protein conformations using 2D/3D lattice representations.
- **Free Energy Calculation**: Compute energy profiles based on residue-residue interactions and structural configurations.
- **Kinetic Simulation**: Model the impact of environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, energy thresholds) on folding behavior.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Modular architecture for defining proteins, residues, and folding rules for reusability and extensibility.

##  Visualization

The visualization component offers an interactive rendering of folding conformations; however, **only a subset of protein structures is displayed** due to limitations in computational resources on the system used for rendering.
